| K-04 | Press left arrow on first input | Focus should remain on first input |
| K-05 | Press backspace on empty input | Previous input should be focused and its value cleared |
| K-06 | Press backspace on filled input | Current input should be cleared, focus remains on current input |
| K-07 | Press delete key | Current input should be cleared, focus remains on current input |
| K-08 | Press spacebar | No action should occur (spacebar input should be prevented) |

## Paste Functionality

| Test ID | Test Case | Expected Behavior |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| P-01 | Paste exactly the right number of characters | All inputs should be filled with pasted characters |
| P-02 | Paste fewer characters than inputs | Only the corresponding inputs should be filled, starting from current position |
| P-03 | Paste more characters than remaining inputs | Only characters up to the available inputs should be used |
| P-04 | Paste with focus on first input | Paste should start filling from first input |
| P-05 | Paste with focus on middle input | Paste should start filling from the focused input |
| P-06 | Paste non-alphanumeric characters | Component should handle special characters correctly |

## Visual State

| Test ID | Test Case | Expected Behavior |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| VS-01 | Empty input | Input should have default styling |
| VS-02 | Filled input | Input should have "completed" styling |
| VS-03 | Focused input | Input should have focus styling according to platform standards |
| VS-04 | Input transitions from empty to filled | Visual transition should be smooth and clear |
| VS-05 | Input transitions from filled to empty | Visual transition should be smooth and clear |

## Accessibility

| Test ID | Test Case | Expected Behavior |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| A-01 | Screen reader announcement | Each input should be properly labeled (e.g., "input position X") |
| A-02 | Keyboard navigation without mouse | All functionality should be accessible via keyboard only |
| A-03 | Focus visible | Focus indicators should be clearly visible |
| A-04 | ARIA attributes | Appropriate ARIA attributes should be present |

## Edge Cases

| Test ID | Test Case | Expected Behavior |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| E-01 | Rapid input of characters | Component should handle fast typing correctly |
| E-02 | Programmatic value changes | Component should reflect changes made programmatically |
| E-03 | Mobile virtual keyboard | Component should work properly with mobile virtual keyboards |
| E-04 | Touch screen interaction | Component should be usable on touch screens |
| E-05 | Browser autofill | Component should handle browser autofill appropriately |
| E-06 | No inputs specified (numberOfInputs = 0) | Component should handle this gracefully (ideally show nothing) |
| E-07 | Very large number of inputs | Component should render and function correctly with many inputs |

## Integration Tests

| Test ID | Test Case | Expected Behavior |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| I-01 | Form submission with OTP | Form should submit with correct OTP value |
| I-02 | Reset form with OTP | OTP fields should clear properly |
| I-03 | Pre-fill OTP from URL parameter | OTP should be pre-filled correctly |
| I-04 | Validate OTP with backend | Validation should work correctly with backend validation |
| I-05 | Work with form libraries (Formik, React Hook Form) | Component should integrate well with form libraries |

## Performance Tests

| Test ID | Test Case | Expected Behavior |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|

| C-04 | High DPI screens | Component should display correctly on high DPI screens |

## Implementation Guidelines for Testing

When implementing tests for the OTP component, consider the following approaches:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test individual functions like `handleOnChange`, `handleOnKeyDown`, etc.
   - Mock events and verify state changes

2. **Component Tests**:
   - Use React Testing Library to render the component
   - Simulate user interactions and verify DOM changes

3. **Visual Regression Tests**:
   - Use tools like Storybook with Percy or Chromatic

4. **End-to-End Tests**:
   - Test the OTP component in a real form flow
   - Verify integration with other components

5. **Accessibility Tests**:
   - Use tools like axe or lighthouse
   - Perform manual keyboard navigation testing

By covering these test cases, you'll ensure that the OTP component is robust, accessible, and provides a good user experience across different scenarios and platforms.
